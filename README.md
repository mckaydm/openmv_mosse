# MOSSE Implementation for OpenMV Camera Board
This was tested on an OpenMV N6 with speeds at about 27 FPS. 

## Quick Setup
1. Add the mosse.py file to a folder in your sys.path.
2. Open OpenMV IDE and run mosse_tracker_man.py with a bbox of your choosing. Note, future work will include a more interactive bounding box selection.
